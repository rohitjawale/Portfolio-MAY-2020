                    <p>Junior UI/UX designer</p><br>
                       
                        <p class="detail">Since the start of my student life, I have always had an interest in the field of Web development they bring to businesses. That’s how I decided to kickstart my career in the field of web development. However, after a year of toiling away in the field of Web development, I realized that what I was doing was not aligning with where I envisioned myself in the future. The work I was doing was becoming more monotonous, repetitive and free of thoughts and creativity. I knew I needed a change, but I was completely stumped as to what direction to take.</p>
                        <p class="detail">Parallelly, I had invested myself as a graphic designer, I then went on to do some contemplation exercises to assess my strengths and passion. I asked myself questions like “What opportunities excite me — and how come?” and “What am I good at and can work on for hours without feeling bored and unfulfilled?”. It was then when I realized that I’m most passionate in the area of design. Keeping design as my main focus, I started approaching design professionals via LinkedIn.</p>
